Hello World!

I'm a very curious software developer. When I'm not working, I'll probably be coding, reading, looking for [new tracks/electronic music artists](https://soundcloud.com/jeanmorais), and watching football and NBA games.

I currently work as a Software Developer at [Neoway](https://www.neoway.com.br/), helping companies through Big Data solutions. 

Although Java is my background,  currently I've been writing more in Python and Golang. Iâ€™m also focused on topics like cloud native solutions, microservices, and DevOps best practices.
