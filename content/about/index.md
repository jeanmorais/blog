Hello World!

I'm a very curious software developer. When I'm not working, I'll probably be researching new things to learn, looking for [new tracks/new electronic music artists](https://soundcloud.com/jeanmorais), and watching football and NBA games.

I currently work as a Software Developer at [Neoway](https://www.neoway.com.br/), helping companies through Big Data solutions. 

Although Java is my background, I have been writing a piece of code in Golang today. I'm also focused on topics like CI/CD, Cloud Computing, Containers, and DevOps best practices.
